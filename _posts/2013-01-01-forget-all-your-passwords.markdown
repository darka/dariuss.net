It seems to be the case that most people either use the same password or similar passwords on many websites they frequent. Since it is not always clear whether your password is stored securely on some website, you can never be sure whether the website's administrator didn't just gain access to all of your precious Internet accounts.

The alternative to using a different password for every website has its own obvious and terrible problem - you are going to forget most of your logins fairly quickly, and noting them down in some text document on your desktop is just stupid.

I have been reading [Getting Things Done][gtd] recently, and this inspired me to finally fix my own password remembering problem.

The system I now use involves the software [KeePass][keepass]. Although the website looks like something from the early 00s, the application itself is quite usable, but most importantly it is:

 * open source (you don't really want any corporation owning all of your passwords);
 * cross-platform (so you can still access your password database when you eventually switch to OS X or Linux).

KeePass allows you to maintain a database of all of your logins and passwords. Obviously, if you are currently using the same password for everything, you will have to spend the evening changing it on every website you visit, but the security you will gain does make it worth it.

The database itself is encrypted, and you can store it where ever you want. What makes most sense, is to just store it on your DropBox account.

The security of the system then depends on two passwords:
 * DropBox account password
 * KeePass database password

Just make sure those two are strong, and you will have a very secure and mind-freeing system implemented!
