PHP is a language and an ecosystem with a huge following, and despite the criticism it has received throughout the years, many major sites, such as Facebook, are still using it.

The truth is, PHP is flawed and generally not a pleasant language to work with, as evidenced by the tone of Yishan Wong, a Facebook engineer, [answering a question on Quora][quora].

In the case that your next weekend project suddenly takes over the world by storm, you don't want it to be written in PHP. Getting a PHP code base to stay clean requires unprecedented effort, so sooner or later you will be forced to either 1) rewrite it, or 2) develop a whole bunch of bureaucratic rules, just to maintain the code at a humanly comprehensible level. However:

 * As most developers are aware by now, rewriting the whole code base is [a very bad idea][badidea].
 * Even Facebook finds it hard to maintain a PHP core, and only allows veteran developers to touch it.

So don't do it. Python is amazing. Ruby is awesome. They are well regarded, and have a bright future ahead of them (so you won't have trouble recruiting).

So please, if you're starting something new, PHP is not the right choice.
